				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>Hello, my name is William Liao.  I was raised in Fresno California. I am a beginner in HTML and CSS. I plan to major in computer programming for my career.  The reason I am into computer programming is because I think it is cool to work with computers and technology is taking over.  I grew up with computers.  When I was in 8th grade I was trying to find out what I wanted to do for my career.  I thought of choosing a computer job.  I talked to someone who majored in computers and he told me that web development was a good job.  I tried out some HTML and CSS.  I liked it so I decided to learn more web development.  Later I talked to a computer programming who majored in the backend programming languages.  He told me to learn C# and Javascript.  He told me those languages are very popular and that his job is high in demand.  I am currently taking C# course online.   </p>
